          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li> The meta element contains metadata to tell the browser how to behave/display the webpage</li>
          <li> The body element contains website content that visible to the user</li>
          <li> HTML tags tell the browser how to interpret and display the various types of content on a webpage </li>
          <li> Sectional HTML helps us structure the content of our webpage in a meaningful way</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li> CSS best practice is to use an external stylesheet and link it in the head element</li>
        <li> Using external stylesheets helps keep each different aspect of our website's code separate - rephrase </li>
        <li>A period preceding a stylesheet element turns it into a selector, allowing us to style multiple HTML elements of the same class </li>

              <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store (and use) data in our code</li>
              <li> Control flow is the order in which code executes (from top to bottom in JS)
              <li> Variables must always be declared before they are referenced in functions!</li>
              <li> Using loops and conditionals allow us to execute and repeat blocks of code according to numeric (e.g. index position) and logical criteria (true/false etc.)
              <li>Just because we have defined a function, doesn't mean it will execute - we have to call it by its name</li>
